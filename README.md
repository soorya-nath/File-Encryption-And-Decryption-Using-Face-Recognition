# File Encryption and Decryption Using Facial Recognition

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is a secure file encryption and decryption system that uses facial recognition for user authentication, ensuring personalized data protection.

## üîß Tools  
- **SHA-256:** Secure hashing for password and data integrity.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network):** Accurate face recognition for user authentication.  
- **OpenCV:** Real-time face detection and recognition.  
- **RSA:** Robust asymmetric encryption and decryption for file security.  

## ‚úÖ Key Features  
- **Secure File Protection:** Advanced file encryption and decryption using facial recognition for user-specific access.  
- **Robust Authentication:** Face recognition using CNN and OpenCV for precise user verification.  
- **Strong Encryption:** SHA-256 for secure hashing and RSA for data encryption and decryption.  
- **Enhanced Accuracy:** Deep learning techniques to boost user identification, minimizing false positives.  

## üöÄ How It Works  
1. **User Authentication:** Users authenticate via face recognition (captured using OpenCV).  
2. **Encryption:** The file is encrypted using RSA, ensuring secure data storage.  
3. **Decryption:** Only authenticated users (verified by face recognition) can decrypt the file.  
4. **Security:** SHA-256 is used for secure hashing and data integrity.
